This program contains 3 songs of increasing difficulty. Furthermore, each song can be played at 3 different speeds. There is also an 'endless' mode, which will loop indefinitely, increasing the speed each iteration. It ends when the player quits or loses. A player can quit any time by holding '#'. A player earns a point for every note they successfully hit. Points are displayed on the winning/losing screen.
